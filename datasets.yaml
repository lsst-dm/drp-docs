exposure_detrended:
    type: dataset
    data_unit: visit+ccd
    description: >
        Science and variance pixel values for a single-visit CCD image, including both snaps.  Mask is tracked separately, as it will be updated on different timescales.  Background is subtracted, but the background model will be tracked separately and can be added back in exactly.  The image will have been resampled to correct for small-scale pixel size variations, and the photometric scaling chosen to match the sky spectrum.

mask_initial:
    type: dataset
    data_unit: visit+ccd
    description: >
        Pixel masks determined from single-visit processing, including cosmic rays, defects from ISR, saturation, and initial single-frame detections.

background_initial:
    type: dataset
    data_unit: visit+ccd
    description: >
        Background model determined from single-visit processing.  Probably stored per CCD, but should correspond to a full-visit fit.

psf_initial:
    type: dataset
    data_unit: visit+ccd
    description: >
        PSF model from single-visit processing, probably estimated on a single CCD using simple discrete-kernel interpolation methods (e.g. PSFEx).  No wavelength dependence.

wcs_initial:
    type: dataset
    data_unit: visit+ccd
    description: >
        Mapping from CCD coordinates to sky coordinates, determined from a full-visit fit to the astrometric reference catalog.  No attempt to account for chromatic effects like DCR.  Appropriate for use with exposure_detrend, so if that has already been resampled to account for small-scale pixel-size variations, that part of the mapping should not be included here.

throughput_initial:
    type: dataset
    description: >
        Photometric scaling function (possibly a scalar per CCD) determined by either a CCD or visit-level fit to the photometric reference catalog.  Does not attempt to account for wavelength-dependent calibration terms.

psf_star_catalog:
    type: dataset
    data_unit: sky
    description: >
        A catalog of securely-classified stars to use in PSF estimation.  Must include true positions (as measured from the average of multiple epochs), proper motion and parallax, and best-estimate SEDs (inferred from colors).  Will include as much information from external catalogs (at least Gaia), but will also need to be extended with LSST data.

wcs_final:
    type: dataset
    data_unit: sky
    description: >
        Mapping from CCD coordinates to sky coordinates, determined from a multi-visit simultaneous fit and all available calibration products.  Should be defined for some nominal wavelength or SED in each band, so subsequence PSF models can account for chromatic shifts from that baseline.  Appropriate for use with exposure_detrend, so if that has already been resampled to account for small-scale pixel-size variations, that part of the mapping should not be included here.

throughput_final:
    type: dataset
    description: >
        Photometric scaling function determined from a multi-visit simultaneous fit and all available calibration products.  Should be a function of wavelength and/or SED, baselined to some nominal wavelength or SED in each filter.

psf_basis:
    type: dataset-placeholder
    description: >

psf_model_final:
